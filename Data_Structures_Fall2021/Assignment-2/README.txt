Binary Search Tree

The program runs in two modes:
1. Insertion Mode
2. Deletion Mode

How to enter into insertion and deletion modes:

1. To enter insertion mode - Press 1
2. To enter deletion Mode - Press 0
3. To exit - Press any other key

In insertion mode, console prompt will ask you to provide size of your input and the elements you want to insert.

Once you provide the elements to insert, program will create a Binary Search Tree (BST).

Console prompt will then ask you to provide input on whether to enter into insertion or deletion mode.

In deletion mode, console prompt will ask you to provide the element you want to delete.

After providing the element to delete, the corresponding node is deleted from Binary Search Tree (BST).

The above process is repeated until you exit from the program.
